# Land of Hop, SvelteKit edition

🗓️ 27.10.2021

I have created most basic pages: list of beverages, beverage details, about, simple statistics and dashboard where I can add and update beverages data. It went very smoothly. I had it done previously in React, so it was just rewrite ready solutions, but I am so impressed that it was so easy and the code is much more readable in Svelte. It is also much more performant.

I do not love [Next](https://nextjs.org/) anymore, Svelte is the best! Simplicity in which I created first form and header animations are incredible. And the app has amazing performance so far with zero effort. I am discovering new, better world.

My fifth attempt to build perfect beer catalogue application. I previously worked on it with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [Next](https://nextjs.org/). Each time it was better experience. Working on Next app gave me a lot of joy. React is not the perfect solution for my needs, though. I really love it, but sometimes it has some issues which tire and discourage me. I mean in general it seems **too complex** for what it is doing. All these discussions about best libraries to handle forms or animations, how to scope CSS, about folder and files structure, paying attension to add `key` property when we `map` lists etc. These issues are not something terrible, but I am looking for something what fundamentally makes developement easier. I already worked with Svelte and Sapper. I abandoned it because I had time when I felt in love in Next, especially in its static site regeneration (SSG). But now I see that SvelteKit appeared, it is very powerful, fulfills my needs. Same time I prefer Svelte simplicity over React. So, that is a bit risky to change so popular, mature framework as Next for SvelteKit, but I believe I will not regret.
