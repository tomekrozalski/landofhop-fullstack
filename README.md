# Land of Hop, SvelteKit edition

My fifth attempt to build perfect beer catalogue application. I previously worked on it with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [Next](https://nextjs.org/). Each time it was better experience. Working on Next app gave me a lot of joy. React is not the perfect solution for my needs, though. I really love it, but sometimes it has some issues which tire and discourage me. I mean in general it seems **too complex** for what it is doing. All these discussions about best libraries to handle forms or animations, how to scope CSS, about folder and files structure, paying attension to add `key` property when we `map` lists etc. These issues are not something terrible, but I am looking for something what fundamentally makes developement easier. I already worked with Svelte and Sapper. I abandoned it because I had time when I felt in love in Next, especially in its static site regeneration (SSG). But now I see that SvelteKit appeared, it is very powerful, fulfills my needs. Same time I prefer Svelte simplicity over React. So, that is a bit risky to change so popular, mature framework as Next for SvelteKit, but I believe I will not regret.

## Developing

Install dependencies by

```bash
npm install
```

and start a development server:

```bash

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
